Intro to Object Oriented Programming.

Today's exercise was about practicing constructing objects and accessing their attributes and methods + modifying objects and calling methods. 

I had to remake the 15th day exercise using predefined classes, only by constructing objects and calling methods, without interacting with the other modules. So coffee_maker.py, menu.py and money_machine.py modules are pre-written by the author of the exercise.
