In today's lesson I learned about classes and objects.

A class is a code template for creating objects. 
An object is created using the constructor of the class. This is done by defining the attributes (the variables that belong to that class) inside the "__init__" method (functions that access the class atributes).

initialization - the assignment of an initial value for a data object or variable

The next script illustrates how classes and objects work, along with initializating/modifying attributes and the use of the methods defined in that class.
